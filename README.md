# Task - Music Genre Classification using Machine Learning Algorithm
Hello internet!


I am going to introduce my first project on internet.
Being a Machine Learning enthusiast I am going to implement a deep learning project which is completely based on Neural Network.
Audio file Manipulation is one of the finest thing in the field of Machine Learning and the task is to represent the code as a audio feature extractor using AI.
I came up with two functions, one performing as a feature extractor and another to load the datatset from the memory which is described in MusicGenreClassification.py Script.
Here, Librosa did a great job for audio manipulation. I mainly imported the wav files and stored inside a json file for future use. Before storing the datas inside a json file, I did feature extraction process using mfcc(Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients), a leading approach for speech feature extraction.
And the final job comes up with the Neural Network Implementation. I used Tensorflow library, an advanced resource from Google,in the backend. Neural Network Implementation concludes falttening, adding new layers and dropping outs as required for building a neural network model.
